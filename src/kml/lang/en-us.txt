Snapshots are development versions which are not guaranteed to be stable and may corrupt your world.
You're advised to run them in separate directories or create regular backups.
This enables selecting old alpha and bveta versions when you add a new launch option.
These are out of date and may be unstable. Any bugs, crashes, missing features or similar will not be fixed.
It is strongly recommended you run these versions in separate directories to avoid world corruption.
This enables changing advanced Java settings when you add a new launch option.
Changing these may cause the game to malfunction.
